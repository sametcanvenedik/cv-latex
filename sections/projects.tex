2024--2025 & \textbf{Industrial Automation and Measurement System(Confidential)}\\
& In-house R\&D Project, Physmart Solutions
\cvitem{
    \item Designed and developed a fully automated measurement and data processing system to reduce manual labor in internal operations
    \item Led end-to-end system development, covering mechanical design, hardware selection, software architecture, and system integration
    \item Designed the mechanical structure and Cartesian motion system using SolidWorks, including integration of linear mechanisms, switches, and peripheral devices
    \item Developed a Python- and Qt-based central control software enabling real-time device control, data acquisition, processing, visualization, and automated decision-making
    \item Implemented multi-process architecture with USB-based communication to STM32-controlled subsystems, real-time system monitoring, fault detection, and diagnostic logging, validated through continuous operational use

& \textbf{Cherenkov Radiation–Based Imaging System for Accuracy Verification}\\
2024--2025 & TÜBİTAK 1507 R\&D Project, Physmart Solutions
\cvitem{
    \item Designed and developed a test and measurement system to verify radiotherapy device accuracy by comparing Cherenkov radiation images with treatment planning data
    \item Led end-to-end system development, including mechanical design, prototyping, software development, and experimental validation
    \item Designed a precision mechanical structure (0.1 mm rotational, 1 mm axial accuracy) using SolidWorks and supported design decisions through basic deflection analysis
    \item Developed a Python- and Qt-based PC application for real-time image acquisition, processing, visualization, and data logging using OpenCV and third-party camera libraries
    \item Validated system accuracy through experimental radiation measurements and comparison with established calibration methods
