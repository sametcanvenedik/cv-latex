# Curriculum Vitae – Sametcan Venedik

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for my academic and professional CV.

The CV is maintained in LaTeX to ensure:
- version control and traceability,
- clean and consistent formatting,
- long-term maintainability.

## Overview

- Field: Mechatronics Engineering  
- Focus areas: embedded systems, control systems, mechanical design, applied R&D  
- Target domains: defense industry, R&D-focused engineering roles

The content emphasizes hands-on engineering work, system-level thinking, and applied research experience rather than generic skill listings.

## Structure

- `cv.tex` – main LaTeX source file  
- Supporting sections are organized directly within the source for clarity and traceability  
- Compiled output is intended for professional and academic job applications

## Versioning

This repository represents a **public-safe version** of the CV.
Sensitive personal information (e.g. reference contact details) is intentionally excluded.

A private submission version is maintained separately when required for applications.

## Notes

This CV evolves over time as projects, research, and professional experience grow.
Commit history reflects meaningful updates rather than cosmetic changes.
